// Blocking the user interaction via right-click and the HTML document in the browser

document.addEventListener('contextmenu', event => event.preventDefault());

// The key method is preventDefault()

// This method is useless though, since the user is able to press the F12 key on the keyboard
// in order to open the DevTools available in every browser.

// Another solution is to apply a simple Python script to gather the code from such a website:

-- Python script --
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Python 3.9.5

# write_html_code.py

# Dependencies
import os
import requests

path = '/home/user/...'             # Enter path for document storage here
os.chdir(path)                      # Change current working directory for write operation later

url = 'https://www.domain.com'      # Enter domain here

response = requests.get(url)        # Response should be 200 (OK)
html = response.text                # Complete source code as string

# Write the whole document to a txt-file:
with open('source_code.txt', 'wt') as outfile:
  outfile.write(html)
outfile.close()
